# spark-java-examples
Since I feel most of Apache Spark examples on the internet exist in Scala, I decided to put some Java examples to let people writing Spark in Java an idea how to use this API.

The examples include:
## Simple log parsing
This example shows how to parse log file, extract text and count occurences of this text.

## UDF
Spark SQL allow users to define their own functions for creating Column. This example show how to do it.
